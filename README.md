# Side Effects and Data Fetching

## Setup

Clone and download this repo, and run `npm install`. Then:

- Run `npm test` to run tests in one terminal tab
- Open another terminal tab, and run `npm start` to run the project in the
  browser

In the tab that is running tests, you can press the `p` key to select a specific
test file to run. For example, hitting `p` and then typing `01.js` will run the
first test.

## Instructions

The `src` directory has two folders: one for the `solution` code, and one for
the exercises. You'll be working in the `exercise` folder.

- `src/exercise/01.js`: Exercise (write your code here)
- `src/exercise/01.md`: Deliverables and helpful notes
- `src/__tests__/01.js`: Exercise test
- `src/__tests__/01.extra-1.js`: Test for extra credit exercise
- `src/solution/01.js`: Solution code (check your work, or look for a hint if
  you're stuck)
- `src/solution/01.extra-1.js`: Solution code for extra credit exercise

Each deliverable in the `exercise` folder has comments to guide your work!

There are some emoji to guide you in the exercises:

- âœ… Instructions where to write your code
- ðŸ‘€ A hint on what syntax to use/what code to write
- ðŸ“ƒ Helpful documentation
